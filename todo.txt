Core Trading Intelligence
Profit Calculator per Pair
Show estimated flip margin: (best sell rate – best buy rate) minus expected fees (if any) and time decay. Include stock depth (e.g., top 5 listings) to gauge how long a rate likely holds.

Spread / Volatility Indicators
Display min/max/median over last N snapshots plus a “tightness” score (small spread = stable). Flag pairs whose volatility recently spiked.

Opportunity Ranking
Compute a composite score (freshness, spread, trend, liquidity) and sort pairs by highest expected ROI/time.

Liquidity Heatmap
Inline bar showing cumulative accessible stock at ascending rates to help decide scale of possible flips.

Multi-Pair Correlation
Detect when changes in one currency (e.g., Divine ↔ Chaos) propagate to fragments/exalted/orbs; warn of cascading shifts.

Alerts & Automation
Threshold Alerts (Desktop + Optional Sound)
“Notify me if divine/chaos best rate > X or < Y.” Can poll and push via Web Notifications or SSE channel.

Under/Overcut Detection
When a new listing sharply undercuts previous best (e.g., >3% drop), highlight pair header in amber/red.

Smart Refresh Scheduler
Dynamically prioritize refreshing hotter or volatile pairs first; throttle low‑signal pairs.

Watchlist / Starred Pairs
Separate section for starred pairs with higher polling frequency and pinned summaries.

Discord / Webhook Integration
Send an embed when a target condition hits (avoids constant tab focus).

Historical / Analytics
Rolling Trend Model
Use exponential moving averages (fast and slow) to show crossovers (momentum turns).

Breakout Detection
Flag when current rate exits previous 24h high/low band (“potential breakout”).

Rate Stability Score
Weighted index of standard deviation, recent drift, and listing churn.

Snapshot Diff Viewer
Click any snapshot point to see diff: which accounts entered/exited top listings since that moment.

Seasonal / Session Patterns
If you run it long enough, surface time-of-day windows with historically better spreads.

UI/UX Enhancements
Inline Filters
Quick toggle: show only hot, only profitable above X%, only stable, only volatile.

Compact Density Mode
Condense each pair row to a single line with sparkline + best + spread + ROI badge for broad scanning.

Keyboard Navigation & Actions
Arrow keys move between pairs; Enter expands; R refresh; H toggle hot; A add new trade.

Visual Rate Ladder
Vertical mini ladder showing top N listing rates stacked, colored by proximity to best.

Custom Themes
Export/import theme JSON (colors, typography) for personalization or sharing.

Data & Persistence
External Export
CSV/JSON export of historical snapshots for offline analysis.

Local IndexedDB Cache (Frontend)
Persist last trade data client-side to render instantly after reload while backend warms.

Integrity / Anomaly Checks
Detect sudden unrealistic rates (e.g., 1 chaos for 1 mirror) and grey them out as probable misclick or stale.

Advanced / Experimental
Predictive Model (Lightweight)
Simple linear regression or Holt-Winters on recent price sequence to project short-term direction with confidence score.

Arbitrage Across Leagues (If Data Accessible)
Compare Standard vs Hardcore vs SSF (if endpoints feasible) for cross-league speculative signals.

Clustered Account Behavior
Tag accounts that frequently appear at the edge of spreads—possibly indicating bots/fast movers; treat their moves as early signals.

Rate Momentum Heatmap
Matrix showing acceleration (Δ change percent) over multiple granular windows (15m / 1h / 6h).

Opportunity Aging
Timer showing how long current best rate has persisted—older may hint imminent movement.

Adaptive Debounce / Refresh
Increase refresh frequency for pairs whose volatility just spiked; decrease for stagnant ones (feedback loop).

Plugin Architecture
Allow dropping a JS file into a plugins/ folder that registers custom scoring logic and UI badges.

Reliability & Ops
Resilient SSE / Fallback
Auto-reconnect SSE with exponential backoff; fall back to batched REST if repeatedly failing.

Rate Limit Budget Display
Show derived “% budget used” plus predicted time to recovery; use color thresholds.

Self-Diagnostics Panel
Display last error traces, endpoint latency averages, and counts of cache hits vs misses.

Config Versioning
Keep a history of config changes (pairs added/removed, account name changes) with rollback ability.

Quality of Life Extras
Multi-Account Highlight
Already partly implemented—surface a color legend (You=Blue, Guildmate=Purple, Friend=Teal).

Temporary Ignore / Mute
Hide specific accounts for a session (if they spam unreasonable listings).

Bookmark Specific Listings
Pin a listing so when its stock changes or disappears you get notified.

Quick Whisper Template Enhancer
Generate pre-filled custom whisper messages with polite variations and quantity adjustments.

In-App Changelog / Tips
Surface subtle new feature hints without needing README dives.

Security / Safety
Safe Credential Management
Abstract cookie session into a separate encrypted store file with read-only runtime access (to avoid accidental commit).

Rate Limit Simulation
Dry-run panel estimating impact of raising refresh frequency (how close it pushes you to limits).

Implementation Priority Suggestion
If you want a focused next sprint:

Phase 1: Profit & spread metrics + opportunity ranking (low overhead, high value).
Phase 2: Alerts (threshold + breakout) + watchlist.
Phase 3: Predictive/analytics (EMA crossovers, volatility band).
Phase 4: Export & plugin architecture for extensibility.
